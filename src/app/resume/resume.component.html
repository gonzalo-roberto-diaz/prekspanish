         <p>My name is Mariana DÃ­az and I am a native of Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>

         <p>I have formed my own company, PrekSpanish, which offers teaching and education consulting services to schools, 
           private institutes and individuals.</p>

         <p>I am also a mother of two girls, Manuela and Zahra, who are completely bilingual.</p>

         <p>My university formation was very traditional, I got a degree in Language and Literature, with a major in Classic Languages (yes, I know Latin and Classic Greek). </p>
         <p>Shortly after my graduation I started teaching Spanish in secondary schools, and as a private tutor.</p>
      <p>Soon, I realized that the approaches traditionally used for teaching foreign languages, based on grammar and translation, 
        weren't satisfactory, and realized the importance of getting my students more involved; specifically, getting them to produce as much 
        actual speech as the alloted class time permitted.
      </p>  
      <p>  
       So I started to intensively study more pedagogical methods and teaching techniques focused on foreign language acquisition. 
       I became a member of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages and attended many of their excellent courses and seminars, 
       I took Art and Acting workshops, I read every Language Teaching book I could lay my hands on, and obtained even more material online. 
       In particular, the material by Ana Lomba, a teacher, mother and businesswoman who developed specialized material on language education for childen, 
       steered me in the right direction when creating my own curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of every new piece of material I studied, I was able to extract what I found valuable, and apply it to my daily teaching experience. Not every new approach worked: I was very fortunate that my employers, both institutional and private, were patient enough to let me experiment new things in my classes. That way, by actual trial-an-error through my professional experience, I was able to shape a set of methods and techniques that produce the best results when teaching a foreign language.
        I have to also give credit, in general, to American schools and institutes, for the degree of freedom they traditionally give to their teachers about how they teach a language, as long as measurable results are achieved.
